# Planes
A 2-D plane dogfighting game written in Python 3.
tkinter and Pillow are used for the graphics and Pyglet is used for audio. The file Sources.txt contains attributions for the art and sound assets used in this project. This game was developed on mac, and I have found some minor issues testing it on windows 10.

tkinter is included in most Python distrubutions, so you will only need to install Pyglet and Pillow (Python Imaging Library) to run this game.
